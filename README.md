# Task Management API

A simple Spring Boot REST API for managing tasks, built with Spring Boot 3 for creating APIs and PostgreSQL as the database.

The project is split into several packages so everything has its own place, which makes the code easier to maintain and develop.

- **/controller**: Handles incoming HTTP requests

- **/service**: Contains the business logic of the application

- **/repository**: Handles persisting and fetching data from the database

- **/model**: Defines the database entity models and the DTO objects used to communicate with the API

- **/exception**: Contains custom exceptions for the application and a global handler defining how to manage each type of exception

DTO Pattern is used in this project so APIs and database arenâ€™t tied together tightly. With this approach, if the database schema changes, it won't break the API. At the same time, we can generate the output which is more suitable for client application.

For transforming data between entities and DTOs, I used MapStruct. It performs all the mappings automatically, making the code cleaner and less error-prone.

To handle exceptions in the application, a Global Exception Handler is defined using @RestControllerAdvice annotation. This means we have one place to catch and format all the errors the application might throw, so the API will always provide a consistent response when something goes wrong.
